**Make AI text sound like a human wrote it.**

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that detects and removes AI writing patterns from Korean and English text. It finds the telltale signs -- the "delve into"s, the triple-item lists, the vague conclusions -- and rewrites them into natural prose.

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases." — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)

## See It In Action

**Before** (AI-sounding):
> AI coding tools represent a **groundbreaking milestone** showcasing the **innovative potential** of large language models, signifying a **pivotal turning point** in software development evolution. This not only streamlines processes but also fosters collaboration and facilitates organizational alignment.

**After** (humanized):
> AI coding tools speed up grunt work. Config files, test scaffolding, that kind of thing. The problem is the code looks right even when it isn't. It compiles, passes lint, so you merge it -- then find out later it's doing something completely different from what you intended.

52 patterns detected across Korean (28) and English (24). See the [full pattern list](#patterns) below.

## Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/devswha/oh-my-humanizer.git ~/.claude/skills/humanizer

# Expose the MAX variant as its own Claude skill
ln -snf ~/.claude/skills/humanizer/humanizer-max ~/.claude/skills/humanizer-max
```

Claude Code will detect `/humanizer` automatically. Add the symlink step as well if you want `/humanizer-max` exposed as a separate skill.

## Use

In Claude Code, type:

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

Korean is the default language. For English:

```
/humanizer --lang en

[paste your English text here]
```

### More Options

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--lang en` | Process English text instead of Korean |
| `--profile blog` | Use blog/essay writing style |
| `--diff` | Show what changed and why, pattern by pattern |
| `--audit` | Detect AI patterns only (no rewriting) |
| `--score` | Get an AI-similarity score from 0-100 |

Combine flags freely: `/humanizer --lang en --audit --profile blog`

### MAX Mode (Multi-Model)

Run the same text through multiple AI models and pick the best result:

```
/humanizer-max

[paste your text here]
```

Each model humanizes independently, results are scored for AI-likeness, and the lowest-scoring (most human) result wins.

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--models claude,gemini` | Choose which models to use |
| `--lang en` | Process English text |
| `--profile blog` | Use blog/essay writing style |

Supported models: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`. `claude`/`gemini` dispatch through `omx ask`; `codex` dispatches through `codex exec`.

## How It Works

```
Your text
  |
  v
[Phase 1] Structure scan -- fix paragraph-level issues (repetition, passive voice)
  |
  v
[Phase 2] Sentence rewrite -- fix word-level issues (AI vocabulary, filler, hedging)
  |
  v
[Phase 3] Self-audit -- "does this still sound like AI?" -- fix remaining issues
  |
  v
Natural-sounding text
```

The skill loads language-specific pattern packs (`ko-*.md` or `en-*.md`) and applies them through this 3-phase pipeline. Profiles and voice guidelines shape the tone.

| 25-28 | Structure patterns (Korean-specific) | Placeholder (no English equivalents yet) |

</details>

## Configuration

Edit `.humanizer.default.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "3.1.0"
language: ko              # ko | en (or use --lang flag)
profile: default          # default | blog
output: rewrite           # rewrite | diff | audit | score
skip-patterns: []         # e.g., [ko-filler] to skip a pack
blocklist: []             # extra words to flag
allowlist: []             # words to never flag
max-models:             # MAX mode models (claude, codex, gemini)
  - claude
  - gemini
```

Pattern packs are auto-discovered by language prefix -- no need to list them manually.

## Profiles

| Profile | Tone | Best for |
|---------|------|----------|
| `default` | Keeps original tone | General purpose |
| `blog` | More personal, opinionated | Blog posts, essays |

```
/humanizer --profile blog text...
```

## Custom Patterns

Drop a `.md` file into `custom/patterns/` and it's automatically loaded:

```markdown

pack: my-patterns
language: ko
name: My Custom Patterns
version: 1.0.0
patterns: 1

Inspired by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)'s plugin architecture: patterns are plugins, profiles are themes.

## Adding a New Language

1. Create `patterns/{lang}-content.md`, `{lang}-language.md`, etc.
2. Set `language: {lang}` in each file's frontmatter
3. Use `/humanizer --lang {lang}` -- auto-discovered, no config changes needed
