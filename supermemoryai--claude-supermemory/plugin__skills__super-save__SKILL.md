# Super Save

Save important project knowledge based on what the user wants to preserve.

## Step 1: Understand User Request

Analyze what the user is asking to save from the conversation.

## Step 2: Format Content

```
[SAVE:<username>:<date>]

<Username> wanted to <goal/problem>.

Claude suggested <approach/solution>.

<Username> decided to <decision made>.

<key details, files if relevant>

[/SAVE]
```

Example:
```
[SAVE:prasanna:2026-02-04]

Prasanna wanted to create a skill for saving project knowledge.

Claude suggested using a separate container tag (repo_<hash>) for shared team knowledge.

Prasanna decided to keep it simple - no transcript fetching, just save what user asks for.

Files: src/save-project-memory.js, src/lib/container-tag.js

[/SAVE]
```

Keep it natural. Capture the conversation flow.

## Step 3: Save

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/save-project-memory.cjs" "FORMATTED_CONTENT"
```
