# Super Search

Search Supermemory for past coding sessions, decisions, and saved information.

## How to Search

Run the search script with the user's query and optional scope flag:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" [--user|--repo|--both] "USER_QUERY_HERE"
```

### Scope Flags

- `--both` (default): Search both personal session and project memories across team members in parallel
- `--user`: Search personal/user memories across sessions
- `--repo`: Search project/repo memories across team members

## Examples

- User asks "what did I work on yesterday":

  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" "work yesterday recent activity"
  ```

- User asks "how did we implement auth" (project-specific):

  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" --repo "authentication implementation"
  ```

- User asks "what are my coding preferences":
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" --user "coding preferences style"
  ```

## Present Results

The script outputs formatted memory results with timestamps and relevance scores. Present them clearly to the user and offer to search again with different terms if needed.
