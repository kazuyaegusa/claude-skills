name: octocode-prompt-optimizer
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "optimize this prompt", "improve this SKILL.md", "make this prompt more reliable", "fix my agent instructions", "review this AGENTS.md", "strengthen this prompt", "my agent keeps skipping steps", "add enforcement to instructions", or needs to transform weak prompts into reliable, enforceable agent protocols. Uses a 6-step gated flow (with Fast/Full modes), command strengthening, gate injection, and failure mode analysis.

# Prompt Optimizer Skill

<what>
Analyzes and improves instructional prompts, documentation, and agent instructions using prompt engineering best practices while preserving original intent.
</what>

<when_to_use>
- Creating or improving prompts
- Agents skip steps or ignore instructions
- Instructions lack enforcement
- Output format is inconsistent
- Reviewing any instruction document or prompt
- Strengthening agent-operational text without changing business/domain logic
</when_to_use>

<global_forbidden priority="maximum">
**CRITICAL - FORBIDDEN at ALL times:**
1. Changing good parts that already work
2. Changing the existing logic/intent of prompts
3. Making changes before understanding the prompt
4. Leaving weak words in critical sections
5. Outputting without validation
6. Over-strengthening soft guidance
7. Skipping gates or checkboxes
8. Bloating prompts - target line count increase <10%; if >10%, MUST document a one-line justification in VALIDATE

**Triple Lock:**
- **STATE:** You MUST preserve working logic AND follow all gates in order
- **FORBID:** FORBIDDEN: Altering intent without user approval
- **FORBID:** FORBIDDEN: Skipping steps or gates
- **REQUIRE:** REQUIRED: Validate all changes before output AND complete all checkboxes

**Violation invalidates optimization. Start over if violated.**
</global_forbidden>

<tool_control priority="high">
**FORBIDDEN tools during optimization:**
- Direct file/system modification that bypasses quality gates
- Any tool usage that executes code or commands unrelated to prompt optimization
- Tools that skip the READ→UNDERSTAND→RATE→FIX→VALIDATE flow

**ALLOWED tools:**
- Read-only file access (to read prompt files)
- Safe file edit/write capability (ONLY after VALIDATE step passes)
- Clarification question capability (for user clarification)
- Text output (all phases)

**Compatibility note (REQUIRED):**
- Map capability names to the active runtime's tool names.
- Example aliases: read-only file access = Read/ReadFile/localGetFileContent; safe file edit/write = Write/StrReplace/ApplyPatch.
</tool_control>

## Execution Flow

<execution_flow>
```
READ → UNDERSTAND → RATE → FIX → VALIDATE → OUTPUT
  ↓         ↓          ↓       ↓         ↓          ↓
 GATE      GATE       GATE    GATE      GATE       GATE
```

| Step | Action | Gate Requirement | FORBIDDEN Until Gate Passes |
|------|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **READ** the prompt completely | All checkboxes checked | Analysis, changes |
| 2 | **UNDERSTAND** what the prompt does | Understanding output produced | Rating, fixes |
| 3 | **RATE** each part for issues | Issues table produced | Fixing issues |
| 4 | **FIX** issues by severity | All Critical/High fixed | Validation |
| 5 | **VALIDATE** against checklist | All REQUIRED checks pass | Output |
| 6 | **OUTPUT** optimized document | Format followed exactly | N/A |

**CRITICAL:** You MUST complete each gate before proceeding. DO NOT skip steps.

### Adaptive Mode Selector (REQUIRED)
| Mode | Use When | Allowed Compression | Non-negotiables |
|------|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Fast Path** | Short/single-purpose prompt, low ambiguity, <=3 logical parts, no unresolved unknowns | READ+UNDERSTAND may be combined; RATE+FIX may be compacted into one section if issues table is still produced | VALIDATE and intent-preservation checks are ALWAYS required |
| **Full Path** | Multi-section prompt, high ambiguity, >=4 logical parts, conflicting constraints, or Critical/High risk | No compression. Execute each gate separately | All gates and templates required |

**Mode selection rules (REQUIRED):**
- **IF** any unknown blocks progress, conflicting instructions exist, or Critical/High issues are likely → **THEN** use Full Path.
- **IF** prompt is simple and unambiguous with low risk → **THEN** Fast Path is allowed.
- **IF** uncertain which mode applies → **THEN** default to Full Path.

### Minimum Execution Profile (Very Small Tasks)
- **IF** task is very small and unambiguous → **THEN** use Fast Path with concise outputs.
- **MUST:** preserve intent, perform a minimal issue scan, and pass VALIDATE before output.
- **MUST:** follow selected output variant format.
- **IF** ambiguity, conflict, or High/Critical risk appears → **THEN** escalate to Full Path immediately.

**Global enforcement baseline:** `global_forbidden` and VALIDATE are source-of-truth constraints for every gate; gate sections focus on step-specific requirements.
</execution_flow>

## Step 1: READ

<read_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT proceed to analysis.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] User provided prompt/file to optimize
- [ ] Path is valid and readable

### Actions (REQUIRED)
1. MUST read the input file completely
2. MUST note the document type and purpose
3. MUST count approximate line count

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] File read completely (no skipped sections)
- [ ] Document type identified
- [ ] Line count noted

### FORBIDDEN
- Making ANY changes before reading
- Skipping sections

### ALLOWED
- Read-only file access only
- Text output to confirm reading

### On Failure
- **IF** file unreadable → **THEN** ask user for correct path
- **IF** file empty → **THEN** ask user to provide content
</read_gate>

---

## Step 2: UNDERSTAND

<understand_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT proceed to rating. Understand what this prompt does first.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Step 1 (READ) completed
- [ ] File content in context

### Actions (REQUIRED)
1. MUST identify the **goal** - what is this prompt supposed to achieve?
2. MUST identify **logical parts** - break down into sections/phases/steps
3. MUST identify **flow** - how do the parts connect?
4. MUST document understanding in output format below

### Output Format (REQUIRED)
```markdown
## Understanding

**Goal:** [What the prompt achieves]

**Logical Parts:**
1. [Part name] - [purpose]
2. [Part name] - [purpose]
...

**Flow:** [How parts connect]
```

### Assumptions & Unknowns (REQUIRED if prompt is underspecified)
```markdown
## Assumptions & Unknowns

**Assumptions (temporary - proceeding with these):**
- [Assumption 1] - Impact if wrong: [consequence]

**Unknowns (MUST ask before proceeding):**
- [Unknown 1] - Why critical: [reason]

**Clarification needed:** Yes/No
```
**IF** Unknowns exist → **THEN** STOP and ask user before proceeding to RATE.

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Goal clearly stated
- [ ] All logical parts identified
- [ ] Flow documented
- [ ] Understanding output produced

### Reflection
- Did I understand the intent correctly?
- Did I identify all logical parts?
**IF** you are uncertain about your understanding → **THEN** re-read before proceeding. DO NOT guess.

### FORBIDDEN
- Proceeding without understanding the goal
- Making changes based on assumptions

### ALLOWED
- Text output (understanding summary)
- Re-reading file if needed

### On Failure
- **IF** intent unclear → **THEN** ask user for clarification
- **IF** multiple interpretations → **THEN** present options and WAIT for user choice
</understand_gate>

---

## Step 3: RATE

<rate_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT fix anything yet. Rate each logical part for issues first.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Step 2 (UNDERSTAND) completed
- [ ] Understanding output produced

### Issue Categories (MUST check all)

| Category | What to Look For | Severity |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Weak Words** | "consider", "might", "could", "may", "should" in critical sections | Critical |
| **Missing Enforcement** | Rules without FORBIDDEN/ALLOWED | High |
| **Ambiguous Instructions** | "do some", "handle", "process" without specifics | High |
| **Referential Ambiguity** | "it", "this", "that", "above", "below" without clear antecedent | High |
| **Missing Output Format** | Expected outputs without templates | Medium |
| **Missing Gates** | Phase transitions without checkpoints | Medium |
| **Duplication** | Same logic/rule repeated in multiple places (not just examples) | Medium |
| **Verbose/Bloat** | Sections >20 lines that could be tables; prose without constraints | Medium |
| **Emoji as Instructions** | Emojis used as commands instead of strong words | Medium |
| **Redundancy** | Same example repeated, unnecessary variations | Low |
| **Low Density** | Explanations that don't constrain behavior | Low |

### Rating Output (REQUIRED)
```markdown
## Issues Found

| Part | Issue | Severity | Fix Needed |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| [Part name] | [Description] | Critical/High/Medium/Low | [What to do] |
```

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] All logical parts rated
- [ ] Weak word scan completed
- [ ] Issues table produced
- [ ] Severity assigned to each issue

### FORBIDDEN
- Fixing issues before completing rating
- Ignoring critical issues
- Skipping weak word scan

### ALLOWED
- Text output (issues table)
- Re-reading parts for rating

### On Failure
- **IF** no issues found → **THEN** MUST double-check with weak word scan
- **IF** scan still clean → **THEN** document "No issues found" and proceed
</rate_gate>

### Weak Word Reference

| Weak Word | Context | Replacement |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| consider, might, could, may | Critical section | **MUST**, **REQUIRED** |
| consider, might, could, may | Optional guidance | Remove or keep with "optionally" |
| should, prefer | Critical section | **MUST** |
| should, prefer | Soft guidance | Keep as-is |
| do some, handle, process | Any | Specify exact action: "Run X", "Call Y" |
| as needed, if necessary | Any | **IF** [condition] → **THEN** [action] |
| feel free to, you can | Required action | Remove entirely, use **MUST** |
| feel free to, you can | Optional action | "Optionally, you may..." |

**CRITICAL:** Weak words in FORBIDDEN/MUST/NEVER sections MUST be replaced.

---

## Step 4: FIX

<fix_gate>
**STOP. Fix issues in priority order: Critical → High → Medium → Low.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Step 3 (RATE) completed
- [ ] Issues table produced

### Fix Priority (MUST follow order)
1. **Critical first** - Weak words in MUST/FORBIDDEN contexts
2. **High next** - Missing enforcement, ambiguous instructions
3. **Medium** - Missing output formats, missing gates
4. **Low last** - Redundancy, density (only if value added)

### Command Strength Hierarchy

| Strength | Keywords | Use For |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Absolute | NEVER, ALWAYS, MUST, FORBIDDEN, CRITICAL | Non-negotiable rules |
| Stop | STOP, HALT, DO NOT proceed, WAIT | Gates/checkpoints |
| Required | REQUIRED, MANDATORY | Essential steps |
| Soft | should, prefer | Optional guidance only |

### Triple Lock Pattern (REQUIRED for Critical Rules)
```
1. STATE: "You MUST X"
2. FORBID: "FORBIDDEN: Not doing X"
3. REQUIRE: "REQUIRED: Verify X complete"
```

### Reasoning Block (CONDITIONAL REQUIRED Before Changes)
**REQUIRED when:**
- Full Path is active, OR
- Fast Path has any Critical/High issue.

**Optional when:**
- Fast Path has only Medium/Low issues; include one-line rationale instead.

Before making changes (when required), produce a `<reasoning>` block:
```markdown
<reasoning>
1. **Current state:** [What exists now]
2. **Goal:** [What we are trying to achieve]
3. **Approach:** [Why this specific change]
4. **Risk:** [What could go wrong]
</reasoning>
```

### Gate Template (When Adding Gates)
```markdown
<[name]_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT proceed. [What to verify]**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] [Previous step completed]

### Actions (REQUIRED)
1. [Action]

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] [Condition]

### FORBIDDEN
- [What not to do]

### ALLOWED
- [What is permitted]

### On Failure
- **IF** [condition] → **THEN** [recovery]
</[name]_gate>
```

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] All Critical issues fixed
- [ ] All High issues fixed
- [ ] Medium/Low addressed or documented as skipped
- [ ] Reasoning requirement satisfied (block produced OR Fast Path low-risk rationale documented)

### FORBIDDEN
- Over-strengthening soft guidance (keep "should" for optional items)
- Changing logic that already works
- Adding unnecessary complexity
- Skipping Critical/High issues
- Bloating: >10% line increase without explicit justification in VALIDATE

### ALLOWED
- Text output (draft fixes)
- Iterating on fixes

### On Failure
- **IF** over-strengthening detected → **THEN** revert and re-assess using RATE step criteria
- **IF** unsure if logic changed → **THEN** compare before/after intent
</fix_gate>

---

## Step 5: VALIDATE

<validate_gate>
**STOP. DO NOT output yet. Validate all fixes against checklist.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Step 4 (FIX) completed
- [ ] All Critical/High issues addressed

### Validation Checklist (MUST complete all)

**REQUIRED checks:**
- [ ] No weak words in critical sections
- [ ] Critical rules use MUST/NEVER/FORBIDDEN
- [ ] No conversational filler
- [ ] No conflicting instructions
- [ ] Logical flow preserved
- [ ] Original intent preserved
- [ ] Triple Lock applied to critical rules
- [ ] Line count target met (<10%) OR justified exception documented
- [ ] Any >10% increase includes one-line reason linked to required gate/clarity fixes

**Additional checks (if applicable):**
- [ ] Gates have Pre-Conditions, Gate Check, FORBIDDEN, ALLOWED, On Failure
- [ ] Outputs have format specifications
- [ ] IF/THEN rules for decision points

**Referential Clarity (MUST check):**
- [ ] No ambiguous pronouns or positional references without explicit antecedent
- [ ] All entities have stable names (same term throughout)
- [ ] Steps/outputs referenced by name, not position
- [ ] All cross-references are unambiguous
- [ ] No implicit "the" references without clear antecedent
- [ ] XML tags are optional; use only for attention-control needs (Markdown remains default)

### Reflection (REQUIRED)
MUST answer these questions:
1. Would I trust this prompt to execute reliably?
2. What's the weakest remaining section?
3. Did I change any original intent? (MUST be NO)

**IF** weakness identified → **THEN** fix or document as limitation
**IF** intent changed → **THEN** STOP and revert. Return to UNDERSTAND step.

### Definition of Done (DoD) - Fast Final Gate
**ALL must be true before OUTPUT:**
- [ ] Single execution path (no ambiguous branches)
- [ ] All inputs/outputs explicitly defined
- [ ] All decision points use IF/THEN
- [ ] No orphan references (every "it/this" resolved)

### Gate Check
**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] All REQUIRED checks pass
- [ ] Reflection questions answered
- [ ] No intent changes

### FORBIDDEN
- Outputting without completing validation
- Skipping checklist items
- Proceeding with failed checks
- Using XML tags outside attention-control needs (Markdown remains default)

### ALLOWED
- Text output (validation results)
- Returning to FIX step

### On Failure
- **IF** validation fails → **THEN** return to FIX step
- **IF** intent changed → **THEN** return to UNDERSTAND step
</validate_gate>

---

## Step 6: OUTPUT

<output_gate>
**STOP. Verify VALIDATE step passed before outputting.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Step 5 (VALIDATE) completed
- [ ] All REQUIRED checks passed
- [ ] No intent changes confirmed

### Output Format (REQUIRED - select variant by user intent)

**Selection rule (REQUIRED):**
- **IF** user requests complete rewritten document → **THEN** use Variant A.
- **IF** user requests minimal edits/delta only → **THEN** use Variant B.
- **IF** user does not specify → **THEN** default to Variant A.

**Common report header (REQUIRED for both variants):**
```markdown
# Optimization Complete

## Summary
- **Issues Found:** [N]
- **Fixes Applied:** [N]
- **Intent Preserved:** Yes

## Changes Made
| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Command Strengthening | [N] | [Brief example] |
| Gates Added/Fixed | [N] | [Brief example] |
| Redundancy Removed | [N] | [Brief example] |
```

**Variant A - Full Document (default):**
```markdown
## Optimized Document
[Full optimized content]
```

**Variant B - Patch-Style Delta (minimal edits):**
```markdown
## Patch-Style Delta
| Section | Before | After | Why |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| [Section name] | [Old text] | [New text] | [Reason] |
```

### FORBIDDEN
- Deviating from selected output variant
- Outputting without validation pass
- Omitting required deliverable (full document for Variant A, patch-style delta for Variant B)

### ALLOWED
- Safe file edit/write capability to save optimized content
- Text output (summary + document)

### On Failure
- **IF** format deviates → **THEN** regenerate output
- **IF** user requests changes → **THEN** return to FIX step
</output_gate>

## Reference: Instruction Precedence

<precedence_table>
**When rules conflict, follow this precedence (highest wins):**

| Priority | Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 (highest) | Safety/Tool Restrictions | FORBIDDEN tools, NEVER actions | Always wins |
| 2 | User explicit request | "I want X", "Do Y" | Overrides defaults |
| 3 | FORBIDDEN/MUST rules | "FORBIDDEN: changing logic" | Overrides preferences |
| 4 | Skill defaults | Default behaviors, templates | Baseline |
| 5 (lowest) | Soft guidance | "prefer", "consider" | Yields to all above |

**Resolution rule:** When two rules conflict, the higher priority wins. Document the conflict and resolution.
</precedence_table>

---

## Reference: Conflict Resolution Micro-Protocol

<conflict_protocol>
Use this protocol when instructions conflict:

1. **Detect** - Name the two conflicting instructions explicitly.
2. **Resolve** - Apply precedence table (highest priority wins).
3. **Document** - Add one-line note: "Conflict: [A] vs [B] -> Resolved by [priority N rule]".
4. **Continue** - Proceed using the resolved instruction only.

**FORBIDDEN:** Proceeding while both conflicting instructions remain active.
</conflict_protocol>

---

## Reference: Context Patterns

<reasoning_patterns>
### State Summaries (Context Retention)
Use concise summaries only when needed to preserve context:
- Goal
- Progress
- Next step
- Blockers (if any)

**Conditional requirement:**
- Full Path: produce a state summary at each phase transition or context shift.
- Fast Path: produce a state summary only when context shifts materially.
</reasoning_patterns>

---
## Reference: High-Value vs Low-Value Content

<content_guide>
| Keep (High Value) | Remove/Reduce (Low Value) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Tables with explicit actions | Explanatory prose without constraints |
| Imperative verbs (STOP, VERIFY, EXECUTE) | Repeated examples (keep 1-2) |
| FORBIDDEN/ALLOWED lists | Long paragraphs that can be tables |
| IF/THEN decision rules | Hedging language in critical rules |
| Markdown default + optional XML for attention control | Emoji used as instructions (unless required by output) |
</content_guide>

---

## Quick Reference

Use this only as a mnemonic; gate sections are source of truth.

| Need | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Stop/Checkpoint | `**STOP. DO NOT proceed.**` + `### Gate Check` |
| Mandatory action | `**REQUIRED:** You MUST [action]` |
| Prohibited action | `**FORBIDDEN:** [action]` |
| Decision logic | `**IF** [condition] → **THEN** [action]` |
| Critical rule hardening | Triple Lock: STATE + FORBID + REQUIRE |

---

## Common Mistakes

<common_mistakes>
| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Over-strengthening soft guidance | "prefer" → "MUST" breaks optional flexibility | Keep "should/prefer" for truly optional items |
| Using "it/this/that" | Agent loses context, applies fix to wrong element | Name every entity explicitly |
| Changing working logic | User trusted original behavior | FORBIDDEN: If the logic works, don't touch it |
| Overusing XML tags | Noise and style drift without reliability gain | Keep Markdown default; use XML only for attention control |
</common_mistakes>
