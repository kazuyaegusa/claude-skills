## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start (CLI)

Run directly from npm without installation:

```bash
npx @kimuson/claude-code-viewer@latest --port 3400
```

Alternatively, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @kimuson/claude-code-viewer
claude-code-viewer --port 3400
```

The server will start on port 3400 (or the default port 3000). Open `http://localhost:3400` in your browser to access the interface.

**Available Options:**

```bash
claude-code-viewer [options]

Options:
  -p, --port <port>                Port to listen on (default: 3000)
  -h, --hostname <hostname>        Hostname to listen on (default: localhost)
  -P, --password <password>        Password for authentication
  -e, --executable <executable>    Path to Claude Code executable
  --claude-dir <claude-dir>        Path to Claude directory
```

### Docker Deployment

Build the image locally:

```bash
docker build -t claude-code-viewer .
```

Run the container directly:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3400:3400 \
  -e PORT=3400 \
  -e CCV_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=... \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... \
  -e ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=... \
  claude-code-viewer
```

Alternatively, use the provided Compose configuration:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> Note: `docker-compose.yml` ships without mounting `claude_home` by default. If you need the container to reuse an existing Claude workspace, map a volume to `/root/.claude`, for example:
>
> ```yaml
> services:
>   app:
>     volumes:
>       - /path/to/claude_home:/root/.claude
> ```


## Data Source

The application reads Claude Code conversation logs from:

- **Location**: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.jsonl`
- **Format**: JSONL files containing conversation entries
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically discovers new projects and sessions

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 20.19.0 or later
- **Operating Systems**: macOS and Linux (Windows is not supported)

### Claude Code Compatibility

- **Minimum Version**: Claude Code v1.0.50 or later
- **Tool Approval Feature**: Requires Claude Code v1.0.82 or later

**Note on Version Support**: Recent versions of Claude Code have adopted more aggressive summarization behavior. To accommodate users who prefer to pin to specific versions, Claude Code Viewer maintains compatibility with Claude Code v1.0.50 and later for the foreseeable future.

### Environment Variables

**CCV_ENV Consideration**: If you have `CCV_ENV=development` set in your environment, the application will start in development mode. For production use, set `CCV_ENV=production` or leave it unset.

## Configuration

### Command-Line Options and Environment Variables

Claude Code Viewer can be configured using command-line options or environment variables. Command-line options take precedence over environment variables.

| Command-Line Option | Environment Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-p, --port <port>` | `PORT` | Port number for Claude Code Viewer to run on | `3000` |
| `-h, --hostname <hostname>` | `HOSTNAME` | Hostname to listen on for remote access | `localhost` |
| `-P, --password <password>` | `CCV_PASSWORD` | Password for authentication. When set, enables password-based authentication to protect access to Claude Code Viewer. All `/api` routes (except login, logout, check, config, and version endpoints) require authentication. If not set, authentication is disabled and the application is publicly accessible | (none) |
| `-e, --executable <executable>` | `CCV_CC_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | Path to Claude Code installation. If not set, uses system PATH installation, or falls back to bundled version from dependencies | (auto-detect) |
| `--claude-dir <claude-dir>` | `CCV_GLOBAL_CLAUDE_DIR` | Path to Claude directory where session logs are stored | `~/.claude` |
| `--terminal-disabled` | `CCV_TERMINAL_DISABLED` | Disable the in-app terminal panel when set to `1`/`true` (env) or when the flag is present (CLI) | (unset) |
| `--terminal-shell <path>` | `CCV_TERMINAL_SHELL` | Shell executable for terminal sessions (e.g. `/bin/zsh`) | (auto-detect) |
| `--terminal-unrestricted` | `CCV_TERMINAL_UNRESTRICTED` | When set to `1` (env) or when the flag is present (CLI), disables the restricted shell flags for bash | (unset) |

**Breaking Change**: Environment variable names have been changed. If you're using environment variables, update them as follows:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_VIEWER_AUTH_PASSWORD` → `CCV_PASSWORD`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_VIEWER_CC_EXECUTABLE_PATH` → `CCV_CC_EXECUTABLE_PATH`
- New environment variable added: `CCV_GLOBAL_CLAUDE_DIR` (previously the Claude directory path was hardcoded to `~/.claude`)

### API Authentication

When `--password` / `CCV_PASSWORD` is set, all `/api` routes (except auth-related endpoints) require authentication. You can authenticate in two ways:

1. **Session cookie**: Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to set the `ccv-session` cookie, then include it in subsequent requests.
2. **Authorization header**: Send `Authorization: Bearer <password>` on each request.

If no password is configured, API authentication is disabled.

### User Settings

Settings can be configured from the sidebar in Claude Code Viewer.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hide sessions without user messages | true | Claude Code creates logs for operations like `/compact` that aren't tied to actual tasks, which can create noise. When enabled, sessions without user messages are hidden. |
| Unify sessions with same title | false | When resuming, Claude Code creates a new session with regenerated conversation logs. When enabled, only the latest session with the same title is displayed. |
| Auto-schedule Continue on Rate Limit | false | Automatically schedules a continue message when Claude hits rate limits. When enabled, the system detects rate limit errors in live sessions and creates a scheduled job to send "continue" one minute after the limit reset time. This prevents manual intervention for rate limit recovery. |
| Enter Key Behavior | Shift+Enter | Specifies which key combination sends messages. Options include Enter, Shift+Enter, and Command+Enter. |
| Search Hotkey | Command+K | Select the hotkey to open search dialog. Options include Ctrl+K and Command+K. |
| Permission Mode | Ask permission | Controls the approval logic when Claude Code requests tool invocations. By default, users approve requests through the UI. This feature requires Claude Code v1.0.82 or later; earlier versions automatically approve regardless of this setting. |
| Theme | System | Toggles between Dark Mode and Light Mode. Default follows system settings. |
| Notifications | None | Enables sound notifications when running session processes complete. Choose from multiple notification sounds with test playback functionality. |
| Language | System | Interface language selection. Supports English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese with automatic system detection. |

## Internationalization (i18n)

Claude Code Viewer currently supports **English**, **Japanese**, and **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**. Adding new languages is straightforward—simply add a new `messages.json` file for your locale (see [src/i18n/locales/](./src/i18n/locales/) for examples).

If you'd like support for your language, please open an issue—we'll add it quickly!

## Alternatives & Differentiation

### Official Solution: Claude Code on the Web

Anthropic provides [Claude Code on the Web](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web), which runs Claude Code sessions in Anthropic's cloud VMs. Each session clones your repository and executes predefined setup commands (e.g., `pnpm install`).

**When to use Claude Code on the Web**:
- Quick testing without local setup or self-hosting infrastructure
- Casual development from mobile devices or public computers
- Simple repository structures with single CLAUDE.md at the root

**When to use Claude Code Viewer**:
- Working with pre-configured local environments (databases, services, large dependencies)
- Monorepo projects with multiple CLAUDE.md files in different directories
- Development requiring significant computational resources or long-running processes
- Preference for self-hosted infrastructure with full control over the development environment

### Community Web Clients

Several excellent community-built web clients exist:

- https://github.com/sugyan/claude-code-webuisupport
- https://github.com/wbopan/cui
- https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui

**What Makes Claude Code Viewer Different**: While these tools excel as general-purpose web clients, Claude Code Viewer is specifically designed as a **session log viewer** with:

- **Zero Information Loss**: Strict Zod schema validation ensures every conversation detail is preserved
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable elements and sub-session modals help manage information density
- **Built-in Git Operations**: Comprehensive diff viewer with direct commit functionality for remote development workflows
- **Session Flow Analysis**: Complete conversation tracking across multiple sessions
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time version and feature compatibility monitoring
- **International Accessibility**: Multi-language support for global development teams

Each tool serves different use cases—choose the one that best fits your workflow and priorities.

## Remote Development

Claude Code Viewer is designed with remote hosting in mind. To support remote development workflows, it includes:

- **Mobile-Optimized UI**: Responsive interface with dedicated mobile sidebar and touch-optimized controls
- **Built-in Git Operations**: Review and commit changes directly from the web interface
- **Real-time Notifications**: Audio notifications for task completion to maintain workflow awareness
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor Claude Code compatibility and feature availability across environments

The application features a separated client-server architecture that enables remote hosting. **Basic password authentication is available** via the `--password` command-line option or `CCV_PASSWORD` environment variable. When set, users must authenticate with the configured password before accessing the application. However, this is a simple single-password authentication mechanism without advanced features like multi-user support, role-based access control, or OAuth integration. If you require more sophisticated authentication, carefully evaluate your security requirements and implement appropriate access controls at the infrastructure level (e.g., reverse proxy with OAuth, VPN, IP whitelisting).
