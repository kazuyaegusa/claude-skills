## Daily Morning Brief - Convex Deployment Fix

**Fixed December 11, 2025** - Resolved Convex deployment error caused by query function in Node.js action file.

### Issue
Convex deployment failed with error:
```
`getFeedItemsForMetrics` defined in `domains/research/dashboardMetrics.js` is a Query function.
Only actions can be defined in Node.js.
```

### Root Cause
- `getFeedItemsForMetrics` was an `internalQuery` defined in `dashboardMetrics.ts`
- `dashboardMetrics.ts` uses `"use node"` directive for actions that need Node.js runtime
- **Convex platform constraint:** Queries cannot use Node.js runtime - only actions can

### Solution
1. **Moved query to correct file:**
   - From: `convex/domains/research/dashboardMetrics.ts` (has `"use node"`)
   - To: `convex/domains/research/dashboardQueries.ts` (no `"use node"`)

2. **Updated reference:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   await ctx.runQuery(internal.domains.research.dashboardMetrics.getFeedItemsForMetrics)

   // After:
   await ctx.runQuery(internal.domains.research.dashboardQueries.getFeedItemsForMetrics)
   ```

3. **Cleaned up imports:**
   - Removed `internalQuery` import from `dashboardMetrics.ts`

**Commit:** `5d52916`

## Daily Morning Brief - Automated Dashboard & Digest System

**Completed December 11, 2025** - Comprehensive automated workflow that runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC to populate research dashboard and morning digest with fresh data from multiple free sources.

### Overview

The Daily Morning Brief orchestrates:
1. **Feed Ingestion** - Parallel ingestion from HackerNews, GitHub, Dev.to, ArXiv, Reddit, Product Hunt, RSS feeds
2. **Dashboard Metrics** - AI-driven calculation of capability scores, key stats, market share, trend lines
3. **Data Storage** - Snapshots stored in `dailyBriefSnapshots` table with versioning
4. **Auto-Refresh** - Frontend components reactively update when new data is available

### Architecture

**Backend Workflow:**
```
6:00 AM UTC Cron → Feed Ingestion (parallel) → Metrics Calculation → Storage
```

**Key Files:**
- `convex/workflows/dailyMorningBrief.ts` - Main orchestration workflow
- `convex/domains/research/dashboardMetrics.ts` - Metrics calculation engine
- `convex/domains/research/dashboardQueries.ts` - Query layer for frontend
- `convex/crons.ts` - Cron job registration (line 158-169)
- `convex/schema.ts` - New `dailyBriefSnapshots` table (line 2819-2867)

**Frontend Components:**
- `src/features/research/components/LiveDashboard.tsx` - Live data wrapper with refresh button
- `src/features/research/components/StickyDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard renderer (unchanged)
- `src/features/research/components/MorningDigest.tsx` - Digest UI (already live)

### Data Sources (All Free)

| Source | Frequency | Data |
|--------|-----------|------|
| HackerNews | Hourly | Top stories, tech news |
| GitHub | Daily | Trending repositories |

| ArXiv | 6 hours | CS.AI research papers |
| Reddit | 4 hours | /r/MachineLearning |
| Product Hunt | Daily | Product launches |
| RSS | 2 hours | TechCrunch, etc. |

### Metrics Calculation

**Capability Scores (0-1):**
- **Reasoning**: AI/ML news volume → normalized score
- **Uptime**: Inverse of outage mentions (min 0.5)
- **Safety**: Inverse of security mentions (min 0.6)

**Key Stats:**
- **Gap Width**: AI capability vs deployment gap (20-45 pts, based on AI activity)
- **Fail Rate**: Outage mentions / total items (0-25%)
- **Avg Latency**: Estimated from AI activity (1.5-2.4s)

**Market Share:**
- Top 3 sources by feed item count
- Rendered as animated donut chart

**Tech Readiness Buckets (0-10):**
- **Existing**: Production/deployed mentions
- **Emerging**: Beta/preview/experimental
- **Sci-Fi**: Future/AGI/quantum

**Trend Line:**
- 6-quarter moving average
- Simulated from current feed volume

**Agent Count:**
- Scales with AI/ML activity
- Tiers: Unreliable (12k-25k), Reliable (25k-50k), Autonomous (50k+)

### Usage

**Automatic:** Runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC, no manual intervention required.

**Manual Refresh:**
```tsx
import { LiveDashboard } from '@/features/research/components/LiveDashboard';

<LiveDashboard fallbackData={staticData} />
```

**Historical Data Navigation:**
The LiveDashboard component includes built-in historical data navigation:
- **Previous/Next Day Buttons** (`< >`) - Navigate chronologically through snapshots
- **Date Picker** - Click any date from last 7 days to view that day's metrics
- **Visual Indicators** - Amber banner when viewing historical data
- **Return to Latest** - One-click button to return to current day
- **Available Data Count** - Shows how many days of data are stored

**Query Historical Data (Programmatic):**
```typescript
// Latest snapshot
const latest = useQuery(api.domains.research.dashboardQueries.getLatestDashboardSnapshot);

// Specific date
const snapshot = useQuery(api.domains.research.dashboardQueries.getDashboardSnapshotByDate, {
  dateString: "2025-01-15"
});

// Last 7 days
const history = useQuery(api.domains.research.dashboardQueries.getHistoricalSnapshots, { days: 7 });
```

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: If one source fails, workflow continues with others
- **Error Logging**: Errors stored in snapshot's `errors` field
- **Fallback Data**: Frontend displays static data if no snapshot exists
- **Monitoring**: Check Convex logs with `[dailyMorningBrief]` and `[dashboardMetrics]` prefixes

### Configuration

**Change Schedule:**
Edit `convex/crons.ts` line 158:
```typescript
crons.daily("generate daily morning brief", { hourUTC: 6, minuteUTC: 0 }, ...);
```

**Customize Metrics:**
Edit helper functions in `convex/domains/research/dashboardMetrics.ts`:
- `calculateCapabilities()` - Capability scoring
- `calculateKeyStats()` - Key stat calculations
- `calculateMarketShare()` - Market share distribution
- `calculateTechReadiness()` - Readiness buckets

See `DAILY_MORNING_BRIEF.md` for complete documentation.

## Research Dashboard Visual Enhancements

**Completed December 11, 2025** - Fixed critical visual bugs in the AI 2027-style StickyDashboard component for dense, terminal-inspired research UI.

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Tooltip Clipping Issue
**Problem:** Hover tooltips on the line chart were being clipped/cut off when appearing near container edges.

**Root Cause:** The `overflow-hidden` class on the main dashboard container prevented tooltips from rendering outside bounds.

**Solution:**
- **File:** `src/features/research/components/StickyDashboard.tsx` (Line 48)
- **Change:** Removed `overflow-hidden` class and added `z-10` for proper stacking context
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="sticky top-4 rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm overflow-hidden p-3 ...">

// After:
<div className="sticky top-4 z-10 rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm p-3 ...">
```

#### 2. Invisible Chart Line
**Problem:** The line chart's primary trend line was not visible on the page despite data being present.

**Root Cause:** SVG `<path>` elements don't understand Tailwind's `text-*` utility classes for stroke colors. The `colorStyle` function was returning `stroke: undefined` and relying on className, which only works for HTML text elements.

**Solution:**
- **File:** `src/features/research/components/InteractiveLineChart.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  1. **Fixed `colorStyle` function** (Lines 20-29) to return actual hex color values:
  ```tsx
  // Before: Returned undefined stroke values
  if (series.color === "accent") return { className: "text-indigo-600", stroke: undefined, fill: undefined };

  // After: Returns actual hex colors for SVG rendering
  if (series.color === "accent") return { className: "text-indigo-600", stroke: "#4f46e5", fill: "#4f46e5" };
  if (series.color === "gray") return { className: "text-slate-400", stroke: "#94a3b8", fill: "#94a3b8" };
  if (series.color === "black") return { className: "text-slate-900", stroke: "#0f172a", fill: "#0f172a" };
  return { className: series.color ? series.color : "text-slate-800", stroke: "#1e293b", fill: "#1e293b" };
  ```

  2. **Added SVG viewBox padding** (Line 236) to prevent edge clipping:
  ```tsx
  // Before:
  <svg viewBox={`0 0 ${width} ${height}`} className="w-full h-full overflow-visible">

  // After:
  <svg viewBox={`-10 -10 ${width + 20} ${height + 20}`} className="w-full h-full overflow-visible">
  ```

### Technical Details

**Key Insight:** SVG elements require actual color values (hex codes like `#4f46e5`) for `stroke` and `fill` attributes. Tailwind utility classes like `text-indigo-600` only apply to HTML text elements via CSS, not SVG presentation attributes.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build compiles with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Chart line renders with proper indigo color (#4f46e5)
- ✅ Tooltips appear without clipping at container edges
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Hover interactions work smoothly

### Files Modified
- `src/features/research/components/StickyDashboard.tsx` - Removed overflow-hidden, added z-10
- `src/features/research/components/InteractiveLineChart.tsx` - Fixed SVG color rendering and viewBox padding

Inspired by Microsoft AutoGen's Teachability, agents can now learn and persist knowledge:

- **Facts** - User name, company, role, tools, preferences
- **Preferences** - Tone, format, brevity, communication style
- **Skills** - User-defined workflows triggered by phrases

### Architecture

- `convex/tools/teachability/teachingAnalyzer.ts` - LLM-based extraction of teachable content
- `convex/tools/teachability/userMemoryTools.ts` - Vector search and skill trigger matching
- `convex/tools/teachability/learnUserSkill.ts` - Explicit skill learning tool
- `convex/domains/teachability/` - Public API for Settings UI
- `convex/schema.ts` - `userTeachings` table with vector index

### How It Works

1. **Inference**: After each response, background analyzer detects facts/preferences/skills
2. **Storage**: Teachings stored with embeddings for semantic retrieval
3. **Injection**: Context handler loads relevant memories before each response
4. **Skills**: Trigger phrases activate learned procedures automatically
5. **UI**: Settings panel shows saved preferences and skills for editing

## LLM Model Registry

- Location: `shared/llm/modelCatalog.ts`
- Purpose: single source of truth for provider/task defaults (OpenAI → gpt-5-nano/mini reasoning models; Gemini → 2.5 flash/pro and image/flash-lite variants; 3-pro preview as fallback)
- Helper: `getLlmModel(task, provider?, override?)` returns the preferred model while honoring explicit overrides
- Tasks covered: `chat`, `agent`, `router`, `judge`, `analysis`, `vision`, `fileSearch`, `voice`
- Usage: import `getLlmModel` and pass to OpenAI or Gemini SDK calls instead of hardcoding model strings
- **Note:** gpt-5-nano/mini are reasoning models that only support the default temperature (1). Do not pass custom `temperature` values when using these models.
- Key call sites wired to the registry (examples): `convex/actions/externalOrchestrator.ts` (chat proxy), `convex/router.ts` (streaming), `convex/domains/agents/fastAgentPanelStreaming.ts` (panel chat + doc generation), `convex/domains/agents/fastAgentChat.ts` (modern chat), `convex/domains/verification/claimVerificationAction.ts` (judge), `convex/tags_actions.ts` (tagging), `convex/domains/documents/fileAnalysis.ts` and `convex/domains/ai/genai.ts` (Gemini analysis/extraction), `convex/domains/documents/fileSearch.ts` (Gemini file search), `convex/domains/ai/morningDigest.ts` (digest summary), `convex/domains/integrations/voice/voiceActions.ts` (voice), `convex/tools/integration/orchestrationTools.ts`, `convex/tools/document/contextTools.ts`, `convex/tools/calendar/recentEventSearch.ts`, `convex/tools/media/recentNewsSearch.ts`, `convex/tools/integration/peopleProfileSearch.ts`, `convex/tools/sec/secCompanySearch.ts`, and `convex/tools/evaluation/evaluator.ts`.

## Email Intelligence & PRD Composer

- **Parser/Entities**: `convex/tools/email/emailIntelligenceParser.ts` extracts companies/people/investors, intent, and urgency from Gmail messages.
- **Research Orchestration**: `convex/workflows/emailResearchOrchestrator.ts` calls enrichment tools, builds action items, and can email a dossier digest.
- **PRD Composer**: `convex/workflows/prdComposerWorkflow.ts` builds an 8-section partnership PRD with validation, citation counting, and optional delivery.
- **Cron Sweep**: `convex/crons/emailIntelligenceCron.ts` runs every 15 minutes via `convex/crons.ts` to process new inbox messages.
- **Scrollytelling UI**: sample narrative data lives at `src/features/emailIntelligence/content/dossierStream.json` with components under `src/features/emailIntelligence/components/`.

---

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The platform uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

- **Coordinator Agent** - Routes queries to specialized agents
- **Simple Chat Agent** - Fast responses for greetings and simple questions
- **Web Agent** - Web search using LinkUp API
- **Document Agent** - Search and analyze internal documents
- **Media Agent** - Find videos and media content
- **SEC Agent** - Research SEC filings and financial data
- **Entity Research Agent** - Deep research on companies and people

### Agent Composition

Agents can delegate to other agents using three patterns:

1. **Single Delegation** - One parent → one sub-agent
2. **Parallel Delegation** - One parent → multiple sub-agents simultaneously
3. **Sequential Delegation** - One parent → chain of sub-agents (pipeline)

**Safety Features**:
- Maximum delegation depth: 3 levels
- Timeout per sub-agent: 60 seconds
- Graceful error handling

### Human-in-the-Loop

Agents can request clarification from users when queries are ambiguous:

1. Agent calls `askHuman` tool with question and optional quick-select options
2. System creates pending request in database
3. UI displays request card in Fast Agent Panel or Mini Note Agent
4. User responds via quick-select or free-form text
5. System validates authorization and continues agent execution

**Security Features**:
- User ID validation on all mutations
- Authorization checks (users can only respond to their own requests)
- Authentication required for all operations

---

## Deep Agents 2.0 Architecture

The platform implements a **frontier-grade deep research agent** architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **CoordinatorAgent** | Top-level orchestrator, handles all requests | `convex/fast_agents/coordinatorAgent.ts` |
| **Orchestration Tools** | Self-awareness + planning | `convex/tools/orchestrationTools.ts` |
| **Context Tools** | Scratchpad + context compaction | `convex/tools/contextTools.ts` |
| **GAM Memory** | General Agentic Memory with boolean flags | `convex/tools/unifiedMemoryTools.ts` |

### 4 Code-Enforced Invariants

The architecture guarantees these invariants **in code, not just prompts**:

#### Invariant A: Message Isolation
- Every user message gets a unique `messageId`
- Tools refuse to mutate state if `messageId` doesn't match
- Prevents cross-query contamination

#### Invariant B: Safe Context Fallback  
- `compactContext` only falls back to previous context if **same messageId**
- Never resurrects old data from previous messages
- All output stamped with `messageId`

#### Invariant C: Memory Deduplication
- `memoryUpdatedEntities` array tracks what was updated
- `isMemoryUpdated` / `markMemoryUpdated` tools for explicit tracking
- Prevents duplicate fact insertions

#### Invariant D: Capability Version Check
- All tools have `writesMemory: boolean` flag
- `capabilitiesVersion` ensures tool validity checks use current catalog
- `sequentialThinking` requires capabilities to be loaded first

### Scratchpad Schema

```typescript
scratchpad = {
  messageId: string,               // Invariant A
  memoryUpdatedEntities: string[], // Invariant C  
  capabilitiesVersion: string,     // Invariant D
  
  activeEntities: string[],
  currentIntent: string | null,
  lastPlan: { nodes, edges, linearPlan } | null,
  compactContext: { facts, constraints, missing, ... } | null,
  
  stepCount: number,
  toolCallCount: number,
  planningCallCount: number,
}
```

### Safety Limits

| Limit | Value | Enforcement |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| MAX_STEPS_PER_QUERY | 8 | Hard stop + summarize |
| MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_QUERY | 12 | Hard stop + summarize |
| MAX_PLANNING_CALLS | 2 | Prevents infinite planning |

### Research Intensity (Boolean-Based)

Research depth is determined by **boolean flags only**, not arbitrary numeric scores:

```
needsDeepResearch = (
  userWantsDeepResearch ||
  memory.isStale ||
  memory.isIncomplete ||
  memory.hasContradictions
)
```

### Workflow

```
User Query
    │
    ├─ initScratchpad(intent) → messageId generated
    │
    ├─ queryMemory → boolean quality flags
    │
    ├─ If multi-entity → decomposeQuery
    │
    ├─ If complex → sequentialThinking (requires capabilities)
    │
    ├─ Execute tool
    │
    ├─ compactContext(messageId) → stamp output
    │
    ├─ updateScratchpad(messageId) → guard mismatch
    │
    ├─ If tool.writesMemory → markMemoryUpdated
    │
    └─ Generate response
```

## Agentic Context Engineering

Based on Nate B. Jones's deep dive synthesizing findings from **Google ADK**, **Anthropic ACE**, and **Manus** architectures.

### The Core Thesis

> **"True Agentic Memory is not a prompt or a database; it is a system."**

Simply increasing context windows (e.g., 1 million tokens) does not solve the memory problem for AI agents. In fact, it often **hurts performance** by introducing noise and "attention scarcity." The solution is a structured memory architecture with explicit tiers, retrieval mechanisms, and isolation guarantees.

### 9 Principles of Agentic Context Engineering

| # | Principle | Description | Status | Implementation |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | **Compiled View** | Context is freshly computed per request, not a running transcript | ✅ | `contextHandler` in `createChatAgent()` |
| 2 | **Tiered Memory** | Working Context → Sessions → Memory → Artifacts | ✅ | Scratchpad → Threads → agentMemory → Documents |
| 3 | **Scope by Default** | Start minimal, pull on-demand | ✅ | Empty arrays, conditional retrieval |
| 4 | **Retrieval Beats Pinning** | Semantic search over permanent context | ✅ | `searchTeachings`, `matchUserSkillTrigger` |
| 5 | **Schema-Driven Summarization** | Structured compression preserves critical details | ✅ | `compactContextSchema` with Zod |
| 6 | **Offload Heavy State** | Pointers to artifacts, not inline data | ✅ | Document IDs, fileIds, sectionIds |
| 7 | **Isolate Sub-Agents** | No shared mutable state between agents | ✅ | `messageId` isolation (Invariant A) |
| 8 | **Design for Caching** | Stable prefixes enable KV cache hits | ✅ | `CACHE_MARKERS`, `PROMPT_VERSION`, `buildCacheOptimizedPrompt()` |
| 9 | **Evolving Strategies** | Agents can update their own instructions | ✅ | `logAgentOutcome`, `analyzeOutcomePatterns`, `storeStrategyRefinement` |

### 9 Common Pitfalls (And How We Avoid Them)

| # | Pitfall | Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---------|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Dump Method** | Context bloat, attention dilution | `compactContext` compression, 30-message limit | ✅ Avoided |
| 2 | **Blind Summarization** | Losing critical details | Schema-driven extraction (facts, constraints, missing) | ✅ Avoided |
| 3 | **Unlimited RAM Assumption** | Token overflow, cost explosion | Safety limits (MAX_STEPS=8, MAX_TOOL_CALLS=12) | ✅ Avoided |
| 4 | **Ignoring Retrieval Latency** | Slow context assembly | `LATENCY_BUDGETS`, `withLatencyBudget()`, `parallelWithBudgets()` | ✅ Avoided |
| 5 | **Monolithic Memory** | No semantic organization | 5 memory tiers with different access patterns | ✅ Avoided |
| 6 | **Cross-Talk Between Agents** | Hallucinations, state corruption | `messageId` guards on all mutations | ✅ Avoided |
| 7 | **Prompt Injection via Memory** | Security vulnerabilities | `validateMessage()`, `fullSanitize()`, `detectInjection()` | ✅ Avoided |
| 8 | **Unbounded Growth** | Memory leaks, cost creep | Per-message scratchpad reset, bounded buffers | ✅ Avoided |
| 9 | **Ignoring Cache Invalidation** | Stale context, wrong answers | `capabilitiesVersion` with TTL, `messageId` freshness | ✅ Avoided |

### 7 Use Cases Unlocked

This architecture enables capabilities that are impossible with naive context management:

| Use Case | Description | Enabling Principles |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Long-Horizon Autonomy** | Multi-day research projects without context loss | Tiered Memory, Compiled View |
| **Self-Improving Agents** | Learning from user corrections and preferences | Teachability, Evolving Strategies |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Coordinator delegates to specialists without cross-talk | Sub-Agent Isolation, Scope by Default |
| **Artifact-Heavy Workflows** | Analyzing 100+ documents without token overflow | Offload Heavy State, Retrieval Beats Pinning |
| **Deep Reasoning** | Analyzing entire repos or datasets as artifacts | Schema-Driven Summarization |
| **Auditable/Compliant Systems** | Traceable decision chains for finance/med/legal | Compiled View, Tiered Memory |
| **Cost-Stable Operations** | Sub-linear cost growth as tasks get longer | Scope by Default, Caching |

### Invariant Enforcement

The 4 Code-Enforced Invariants (documented above) map directly to Agentic Context Engineering principles:

| Invariant | Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **A: Message Isolation** | Isolate Sub-Agents | `messageId` mismatch → mutation refused |
| **B: Safe Context Fallback** | Compiled View | Only same-messageId context preserved |
| **C: Memory Deduplication** | Scope by Default | `memoryUpdatedEntities` tracking |
| **D: Capability Version Check** | Design for Caching | `capabilitiesVersion` with TTL |

## Skills System

The platform implements a **Skills System** based on Anthropic's Skills specification (v1.0, October 2025). Skills are pre-defined multi-step workflows that combine tools for common tasks.

### What Are Skills?

Skills sit between atomic tools and full agent delegation:

| Layer | Example | Token Cost |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Tools** | `createDocument`, `searchMedia` | Low (single operation) |
| **Skills** | "Company Research Workflow" | Medium (instructions loaded on-demand) |
| **Delegation** | "Delegate to SECAgent" | High (full agent context) |

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Skills use a **progressive disclosure** pattern for token efficiency:

1. **Discovery**: `searchAvailableSkills` - Returns only skill names + brief descriptions
2. **Browsing**: `listSkillCategories` - Browse skills by category
3. **Loading**: `describeSkill` - Load full markdown instructions on-demand

This achieves **90%+ token savings** compared to loading all instructions upfront.

### Core Skills

| Skill | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `company-research` | Research | Comprehensive company research with SEC filings, news, and dossier creation |
| `document-creation` | Document | Create structured documents from research findings |
| `media-research` | Media | Find and analyze videos, images, and media content |
| `financial-analysis` | Financial | Analyze financial data, SEC filings, and market trends |
| `bulk-entity-research` | Research | Research multiple entities in parallel with CSV export |

### Skill Format (SKILL.md)

Skills follow the Anthropic specification with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: company-research
description: Research a company comprehensively
license: Apache-2.0
allowed-tools:
  - delegateToAgent
  - searchAvailableTools
  - invokeTool
---

## Company Research Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Company
...
```

### Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `skills` | Skill definitions with embeddings for semantic search |
| `skillUsage` | Usage tracking for analytics |
| `skillSearchCache` | Cached search results for performance |

### Frontend Integration

The Skills Panel in Fast Agent Panel provides:
- **Search**: Hybrid search (BM25 + semantic) for skill discovery
- **Browse**: Category-based filtering
- **Quick Use**: One-click skill insertion into chat

### Seeding Skills

```bash
# Seed core skills to database
npx convex run tools/meta/seedSkillRegistry:seedSkillRegistry
```

---

## Knowledge Graph System

The platform includes a **claim-based Knowledge Graph** for entity analysis, clustering, and outlier detection:

### Core Concepts

- **Claim Graphs**: Represent knowledge as SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object) triples with provenance
- **Graph Fingerprints**: Semantic (embedding) and structural (WL hash) fingerprints for similarity
- **Clustering**: HDBSCAN for natural grouping with automatic outlier detection
- **Novelty Detection**: One-Class SVM "soft hull" for identifying unusual entities

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `knowledgeGraphs` | Top-level graph container with fingerprints |
| `graphClaims` | Individual claims (SPO triples) with embeddings |
| `graphEdges` | Relations between claims (supports, contradicts, etc.) |
| `graphClusters` | HDBSCAN clustering results with centroids |

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `buildKnowledgeGraph` | Extract claims from entity/theme/artifact |
| `fingerprintKnowledgeGraph` | Generate semantic + structural fingerprints |
| `groupAndDetectOutliers` | Run HDBSCAN clustering, mark odd-ones-out |
| `checkNovelty` | Test if new graph fits cluster support region |
| `explainSimilarity` | Compare two graphs with shared/different claims |

### Boolean Outputs

All clustering results use **boolean flags** (no magic scores):
- `isOddOneOut` - HDBSCAN noise label
- `isInClusterSupport` - One-Class SVM inlier/outlier
- `clusterId` - Assigned cluster (null = outlier)

---

## Artifact Streaming & Per-Section Linking

Real-time artifact extraction and per-section linking for dossiers and research reports.

### Overview

When the Coordinator runs research tools, artifacts (URLs, sources) are automatically:
1. **Extracted** from tool results
2. **Persisted** to the database with deduplication
3. **Linked** to the current dossier section
4. **Displayed** in per-section MediaRails and a global SourcesLibrary

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `artifacts` | Persisted URL artifacts with metadata |
| `artifactLinks` | Section → artifact mapping |
| `artifactRunMeta` | Per-run metadata (total count, status) |
| `evidenceLinks` | Fact → artifact mapping (for citations) |

### Per-Section Linking

The Coordinator calls `setActiveSection` before each section's research:

```typescript
setActiveSection({ sectionKey: "market_landscape", runId })
linkupSearch("Tesla market analysis")  // → linked to "market_landscape"
```

**Section Keys**: `executive_summary`, `company_overview`, `market_landscape`, `funding_signals`, `product_analysis`, `competitive_analysis`, `founder_background`, `investment_thesis`, `risk_flags`, `open_questions`, `sources_and_media`

### Frontend Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `MediaRail` | Horizontal strip of artifacts under each section |
| `EvidenceChips` | Inline `[1][2][3]` chips at `{{fact:*}}` anchors |
| `SourcesLibrary` | Global footer with all artifacts |

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `convex/lib/withArtifactPersistence.ts` | Tool wrapper for extraction |
| `convex/lib/artifactPersistence.ts` | Durable persistence with retry |
| `shared/sectionIds.ts` | Stable section ID generation |
| `src/components/artifacts/` | MediaRail, EvidenceChips, SourcesLibrary |

### 2025-12-06 - Feed UX Improvements & Load More Pagination 

**Status**: 

#### Overview
Fixed first-load UX issues with the Welcome Landing feed and implemented pagination with a "Load More" button.

#### Changes

**First Load & Dimming Fix:**
- `src/features/research/components/InstantSearchBar.tsx` - Changed `autoFocus` default from `true` to `false`
- Feed is now fully visible on first load; dimming only triggers when user explicitly clicks the search bar
- Smooth fade transition when entering "Cinema Mode"

**Load More Pagination:**
- `src/features/research/views/WelcomeLanding.tsx` - Added `feedLimit` state (initial: 12)
- Live feed query now uses dynamic limit: `useQuery(api.feed.get, { limit: feedLimit })`
- Added "Load More" button that increases limit by 12 on each click
- Button styled with shadow and hover effects for visual feedback

**Full-Width Feed Grid:**
- Removed `max-w-[1600px]` constraint from feed container
- Grid now uses full available width (`w-full`) for better data density on large monitors

#### Verification
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Hot reload working correctly
- Feed visible immediately on page load
- Dimming only triggers on search bar click
- Load More button increments feed limit

  redesign) to make the page production-ready for banker workflows.

#### User Experience
- Default hierarchy: Outcome header → company dossiers → newsletter
  preview → sources (collapsible) → provenance & search steps
  (collapsible).
- Clear handling for zero or sparse results, with suggestions for
  broadening criteria.
- Clean, markdown-based analysis section that adapts its heading based
  on whether dossiers are present.

### 2025-11-13 - Enhanced Funding Tools & Dossier Enrichment ✅

**Status**: Backend tools live, used by Web Agent / WelcomeLanding

#### Highlights
- Added **smartFundingSearch** tool with automatic date-range
  expansion:
  - Today → last 3 days → last 7 days.
  - Returns structured fallback metadata (`applied`, `originalDate`,
    `expandedTo`, `reason`) and a flag when enrichment is recommended.
- Implemented enrichment tools:
  - **enrichFounderInfo** – founder backgrounds, prior exits,
    education, notable achievements.
  - **enrichInvestmentThesis** – why investors funded the company,
    catalysts, competitive advantages, and risks.
  - **enrichPatentsAndResearch** – patents, research papers, and
    clinical trials (especially for life sciences).

### 2025-12-03 - BlockNote Editor Schema Fix & Deep Agent Concurrent Edit System ✅

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Editor Fully Functional

#### Overview
Fixed critical BlockNote editor schema error and implemented comprehensive concurrent edit system for Deep Agent document modifications with sequential processing, visual indicators, and version validation.

#### Issues Fixed

##### 1. **BlockNote "Every schema needs a 'text' type" Error**
- **Root Cause**: Client code expected Convex API re-exports at `convex/` root level, but implementations were in domain-organized directories
- **Solution**: Created re-export files for backward compatibility:
  - `convex/prosemirror.ts` - Re-exports prosemirror sync functions
  - `convex/tags.ts` - Re-exports tag functions
  - `convex/presence.ts` - Re-exports presence functions
  - `convex/agentsPrefs.ts` - Agent preferences API
- **Result**: Editor now initializes correctly without schema errors

##### 2. **BlockNote Import Path Issue**
- **Problem**: `filterSuggestionItems` import from `@blocknote/core` was failing
- **Solution**: Updated import to `@blocknote/core/extensions` (API change in newer versions)
- **File**: `src/features/editor/components/UnifiedEditor.tsx` line 20

#### Deep Agent Concurrent Edit System

# Nodebench AI Intelligence Engine: Product Requirement Document (PRD)
**Version:** 2.0 | **Status:** Approved for Engineering | **Scope:** Backend Agent Architecture



## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the architectural requirements for the **Nodebench AI Intelligence Engine**, a high-end, self-adaptive research platform. The system transitions from fragile, heuristic-based logic to a **durable, agent-driven architecture** powered by Convex.

**Core Philosophy:**
1.  **Self-Adaptive:** The system determines its own execution path (Fast Stream vs. Deep Research) via LLM reasoning, not client-side `if/else` blocks.
2.  **Durable & Self-Healing:** All complex operations are wrapped in transactional workflows that survive server restarts and automatically retry transient failures.
3.  **Multi-Modal Realtime:** The same intelligence backend powers both high-frequency text streaming and low-latency voice interfaces.



## 2. System Architecture: The "Router & Worker" Model

### 2.1 The Adaptive Router (The Entry Point)
**Requirement:** All incoming user requests must pass through a centralized "Coordinator Agent" that classifies intent before execution.
**Mechanism:**
*   Use `generateObject` to classify requests into `SIMPLE` (Direct Response) or `COMPLEX` (Research Plan).
*   **Implementation:**
    ```typescript
    // The Router decides the path
    const plan = await coordinator.generateObject(ctx, {
      prompt: "Classify and plan: Simple response or Multi-step research?",
      schema: z.object({ mode: z.enum(["simple", "complex"]), tasks: z.array(...) })
    });
    ```
*   **Optimization:** This removes client-side heuristics. The agent "heals" bad requests by re-planning rather than failing.
*   **Documentation:** [Generating Structured Objects](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)

### 2.2 Path A: The Fast Stream (Low Latency)
**Requirement:** For `SIMPLE` queries, the system must provide immediate feedback (<200ms TTFB).
**Mechanism:**
*   Bypass the heavy workflow engine.
*   Invoke a lightweight Agent (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) with `stepCountIs(1)` constraints.
*   **Streaming:** Use `streamText` with `saveStreamDeltas: true` to write incremental updates directly to the Convex Database.
*   **Documentation:** [Agent Streaming](https://docs.convex.dev/agents) | [Retrieving Streamed Deltas](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)

### 2.3 Path B: The Deep Thinking Workflow (High Fidelity)
**Requirement:** For `COMPLEX` queries, the system must orchestrate multiple specialized sub-agents without timing out or losing state.
**Mechanism:**
*   **Orchestration:** Use the **Convex Workflow** component. This ensures that if a 5-minute research task fails at minute 4, it retries from the last checkpoint, not the beginning.
*   **Parallelism:** Execute sub-tasks (e.g., "Search SEC Filings" and "Check TechCrunch") in parallel using `step.runAction`.
*   **Infrastructure:** Wrap logic in `WorkflowManager` to utilize the `Workpool` for concurrency limits (preventing rate-limit bans).
*   **Documentation:** [Workflow Component](https://www.convex.dev/components) | [Durable Workflows & Guarantees](https://stack.convex.dev/durable-workflows-and-strong-guarantees)



## 3. Core Agent Capabilities

### 3.1 Tooling & External Access (Width)
**Requirement:** Agents must possess "Width" (access to the outside world) to ground their research.
**Tools Implementation:**
*   **Web Search:** Integration with Linkup/Tavily APIs via `createTool`.
*   **RAG:** Hybrid search over internal documents using the **Convex Agent** hybrid search capabilities.
*   **Documentation:** [Agent Tools](https://docs.convex.dev/agents) | [RAG with Agent Component](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)

### 3.2 Context Management (Memory)
**Requirement:** The agent must adapt its context window dynamically based on the task phase (e.g., "don't read the whole thread when summarizing a single document").
**Mechanism:**
*   Use `contextHandler` to programmatically filter, summarize, or inject specific memories before the prompt hits the LLM.
*   **Documentation:** [Full Context Control](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)

### 3.3 Self-Correction (Quality Control)
**Requirement:** The system must detect hallucinations or poor outputs without human intervention.
**Mechanism:**
*   **Critic Loop:** A Workflow step where a secondary agent (The "Grader") reviews the output of the primary agent.
*   **Loop:** If the score is < 80%, the workflow loops back to the generation step with feedback.
*   **Documentation:** [Building Reliable Workflows](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)



## 4. Realtime & Voice Interfaces

### 4.1 Unified Voice Backend
**Requirement:** The platform must support a "Phone Mode" or "Voice Chat" without duplicating logic.
**Mechanism:**
*   **Transport:** Use Convex `httpAction` to receive events from voice clients (RTVI / Daily Bots).
*   **Logic:** The HTTP action triggers the *exact same* Agent/Workflow logic used by the text chat.
*   **Response:** Results are piped back via HTTP or stored in the DB for the frontend to reactively update.
*   **Documentation:** [Shop Talk: Voice Agents](https://stack.convex.dev/shop-talk-building-a-voice-controlled-shopping-list-app-with-daily-bots-and-convex) | [Realtime Capabilities](https://docs.convex.dev/realtime)

### 4.2 Hybrid Streaming
**Requirement:** Voice and Text must remain in sync.
**Mechanism:**
*   Use **Persistent Text Streaming** to allow the voice provider to read tokens as they are generated, while simultaneously updating the web UI.
*   **Documentation:** [Persistent Text Streaming Component](https://www.convex.dev/components)



## 5. Reliability & Infrastructure Optimization

### 5.1 Production Guardrails
**Requirement:** Prevent "Runaway Agents" from draining credits or crashing the DB.
**Mechanism:**
*   **Rate Limiting:** Use the **Rate Limiter Component** to cap tokens-per-minute per user.
*   **Usage Tracking:** Implement `usageHandler` to log token consumption for billing.
*   **Documentation:** [Rate Limiter Component](https://www.convex.dev/components) | [Usage Tracking](https://docs.convex.dev/agents)

### 5.2 Performance Tuning
**Requirement:** High-throughput mutations (e.g., streaming chunks from 100 concurrent agents) must not cause conflicts.
**Mechanism:**
*   **Sharded Counters:** Use **Sharded Counter Component** for tracking stats.
*   **Hot/Cold Tables:** Separate "Streaming Deltas" (high write) from "Thread Metadata" (low write) to minimize transaction conflicts.
*   **Documentation:** [Sharded Counter](https://www.convex.dev/components) | [High Throughput Patterns](https://stack.convex.dev/high-throughput-mutations-via-precise-queries)
