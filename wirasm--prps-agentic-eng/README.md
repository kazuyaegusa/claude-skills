## What is PRP?

**Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)** = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook

The minimum viable packet an AI needs to ship production-ready code on the first pass.

A PRP supplies an AI coding agent with everything it needs to deliver a vertical slice of working software—no more, no less.

### How PRP Differs from Traditional PRD

A traditional PRD clarifies _what_ the product must do and _why_ customers need it, but deliberately avoids _how_ it will be built.

A PRP keeps the goal and justification sections of a PRD yet adds AI-critical layers:

- **Context**: Precise file paths, library versions, code snippet examples
- **Patterns**: Existing codebase conventions to follow
- **Validation**: Executable commands the AI can run to verify its work

## Commands

The `.claude/commands/prp-core/` directory contains the core PRP workflow commands:

### Core Workflow

| Command          | Description                                              |

| `/prp-plan`      | Create implementation plan (from PRD or free-form input) |
| `/prp-implement` | Execute a plan with validation loops                     |

### Issue & Debug Workflow

| Command                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/prp-issue-investigate` | Analyze GitHub issue, create implementation plan |
| `/prp-issue-fix`         | Execute fix from investigation artifact          |
| `/prp-debug`             | Deep root cause analysis with 5 Whys methodology |

### Git & Review

| Command       | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/prp-commit` | Smart commit with natural language file targeting |
| `/prp-pr`     | Create PR with template support                   |
| `/prp-review` | Comprehensive PR code review                      |

### Autonomous Loop

| Command             | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/prp-ralph`        | Start autonomous loop until all validations pass |
| `/prp-ralph-cancel` | Cancel active Ralph loop                         |

## Ralph Loop (Autonomous Execution)

Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) - a self-referential loop that keeps iterating until the job is actually done.

### How It Works

```
/prp-ralph .claude/PRPs/plans/my-feature.plan.md --max-iterations 20
```

1. Claude implements the plan tasks
2. Runs all validation commands (type-check, lint, tests, build)
3. If any validation fails → fixes and re-validates
4. Loop continues until ALL validations pass
5. Outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and exits

Each iteration, Claude sees its previous work in files and git history. It's not starting fresh - it's debugging itself.

### Setup

The stop hook must be configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/prp-ralph-stop.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Usage

```bash
# Create a plan
/prp-plan "add user authentication with JWT"

# Let Ralph loose
/prp-ralph .claude/PRPs/plans/add-user-auth.plan.md --max-iterations 20

# Cancel if needed
/prp-ralph-cancel
```

### Tips

- Always use `--max-iterations` (default: 20) to prevent infinite loops
- Works best with plans that have clear, testable validation commands
- State is tracked in `.claude/prp-ralph.state.md`
- Progress and learnings are captured in the implementation report

## Workflow Overview

### Large Features: PRD → Plan → Implement

```
/prp-prd "user authentication system"
    ↓
Creates PRD with Implementation Phases table
    ↓
/prp-plan .claude/PRPs/prds/user-auth.prd.md
    ↓
Auto-selects next pending phase, creates plan
    ↓
/prp-implement .claude/PRPs/plans/user-auth-phase-1.plan.md
    ↓
Executes plan, updates PRD progress, archives plan
    ↓
Repeat /prp-plan for next phase
```

### Medium Features: Direct to Plan

```
/prp-plan "add pagination to the API"
    ↓
Creates implementation plan from description
    ↓
/prp-implement .claude/PRPs/plans/add-pagination.plan.md
```

### Bug Fixes: Issue Workflow

```
/prp-issue-investigate 123
    ↓
Analyzes issue, creates investigation artifact
    ↓
/prp-issue-fix 123
    ↓
Implements fix, creates PR
```

## Artifacts Structure

All artifacts are stored in `.claude/PRPs/`:

```
.claude/PRPs/
├── prds/              # Product requirement documents
├── plans/             # Implementation plans
│   └── completed/     # Archived completed plans
├── reports/           # Implementation reports
├── issues/            # Issue investigation artifacts
│   └── completed/     # Archived completed investigations
└── reviews/           # PR review reports
```

---

## PRD Phases

PRDs include an Implementation Phases table for tracking progress:

```markdown
| #   | Phase | Description | Status      | Parallel | Depends | PRP Plan |
| --- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 1   | Auth  | User login  | complete    | -        | -       | [link]   |
| 2   | API   | Endpoints   | in-progress | -        | 1       | [link]   |
| 3   | UI    | Frontend    | pending     | with 4   | 2       | -        |
| 4   | Tests | Test suite  | pending     | with 3   | 2       | -        |
```

- **Status**: `pending` → `in-progress` → `complete`
- **Parallel**: Phases that can run concurrently (in separate worktrees)
- **Depends**: Phases that must complete first

---

## PRP Best Practices

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Bounded Scope**: Each plan should be completable by an AI in one loop

## Parallel Development with Worktrees

When PRD phases can run in parallel:

```bash
# Phase 3 and 4 can run concurrently
git worktree add -b phase-3-ui ../project-phase-3
git worktree add -b phase-4-tests ../project-phase-4

# Run Claude in each
cd ../project-phase-3 && claude
cd ../project-phase-4 && claude
```
